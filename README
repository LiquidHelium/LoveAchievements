Love Achievements

Love Achievements is an achievements system for Love2d, it aims to be easy to intergrate into your games and lightweight.

Licened under the zlib/libpng license, so no need to ask me for permission

To use copy the achievments directory into your love folder, so you have achievements.lua in achievements/achievements.lua

then add the following to the top of your main.lua 
require("achievements/achievements")

then add this to the your love.load() method
achievementSystem = AchievementSystem.New()


then add this to the your love.update() method
achievementSystem:Update()

then add this to the your love.draw() method
achievementSystem:Draw()

then edit achievements/config.lua to add some achievments, there are some examples in there already, you should probably remove them, they follow this syntax:
achievementSystem:CreateAchievement(UniqueID, Title, Description, imagename)

the imagename should just be name.ext and refer to a file in achievements/img you should add your own images here

to unlock an achievment you need to use
achievementSystem:UnlockAchievement(UniqueID)

in your code
